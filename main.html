<h1>Australia</h1>
<br>
<p>Australia’s holidays are a vibrant mix of cultural celebration, outdoor adventure, and reflection. Australia Day on January 26 is marked by fireworks, parades, and festivities, celebrating the nation's modern founding, though it also brings attention to the history of Indigenous Australians. Anzac Day, on April 25, is a solemn day of remembrance for soldiers who served and died in conflicts, with dawn services and parades held across the country. Christmas in Australia is a warm, beach-filled event in the height of summer, celebrated with barbecues, beach trips, and outdoor gatherings. Easter often sees Australians taking long weekend getaways, enjoying egg hunts and church services. Another favorite is Melbourne Cup Day, held on the first Tuesday of November, which combines horse racing with fashion and festivities. Together, these holidays reflect Australia’s unique blend of outdoor lifestyle, community spirit, and respect for history.</p>
